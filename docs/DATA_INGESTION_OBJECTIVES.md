# Data Ingestion Objectives & Ideal Scenario

## Overview
This document describes the objectives and the ideal, logical flow for the data ingestion system in Fetchbar. It covers both the frontend and backend, focusing on the user experience and business logic, not technical implementation. This serves as a benchmark for tracking progress and ensuring the system meets real-world needs.

---

## Objectives
- Allow real estate clients to easily provide their property data to Fetchbar, regardless of their technical background or data source.
- Support the most common real estate data formats and connection methods.
- Ensure the process is fast, intuitive, and error-resistant.
- Make it possible for a new client to go from signup to having their data searchable in minutes.
- Provide clear feedback, validation, and support throughout the process.

---

## Frontend: Ideal User Experience
1. **Onboarding Step**
   - After signing up, the client is guided to a data integration page.

2. **Data Source Selection**
   - The client is presented with clear options:
     - Connect to a listing platform (MLS, IDX, SaaS) via API key or OAuth
     - Paste a public feed URL (XML, JSON, or CSV)
     - Upload a file (CSV, Excel, or JSON)
     - (Optional) Request help for custom integrations

3. **Guided Input**
   - For each method, the UI provides:
     - Simple instructions and tooltips
     - Example formats or templates
     - Validation for required fields before upload/connection

4. **Progress & Feedback**
   - The client sees a progress indicator during upload or data fetching
   - On success, a clear confirmation and next steps are shown
   - On error, actionable feedback is provided (e.g., missing fields, invalid format)

5. **Review & Confirmation**
   - The client can review a summary of imported listings before finalizing
   - Option to re-upload or correct data if needed

6. **Seamless Transition**
   - After successful ingestion, the client is guided to the next onboarding step (e.g., getting their embed code)

---

## Backend: Ideal Business Logic
1. **Receive Data**
   - Accept data from all supported sources (API, feed URL, file upload)
   - Validate the data for required fields and logical consistency

2. **Data Normalization**
   - Convert all incoming data to a standard internal format
   - Handle different field names, units, and formats gracefully

3. **Error Handling**
   - Detect and report missing or invalid data
   - Log all errors and provide clear feedback to the frontend
   - Allow partial imports with warnings if some records are invalid

4. **Data Storage**
   - Store validated listings in the database, linked to the client
   - Ensure no duplicate listings are created

5. **Import Status Tracking**
   - Track the status of each import (pending, processing, complete, error)
   - Allow clients to view the status and history of their imports

6. **Security & Privacy**
   - Ensure all data is securely transmitted and stored
   - Only authorized users can upload or view their data

7. **Extensibility**
   - The system is designed so new data source types can be added easily in the future

---

## Success Criteria
- A new client can provide their data and see it imported and ready for search in under 10 minutes
- The system supports at least API/feed connection and file upload for MVP
- All errors are clearly communicated and easy to resolve
- The process is as simple as possible for non-technical users
- The backend can handle real-world data variations and scale to thousands of listings per client

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: File Upload MVP
- **Action Points:**
  - Add a simple upload form for CSV/JSON files on the admin page
  - Allow user to select and submit a file
  - Show upload progress and completion status
- **Validation Points:**
  - User can upload a file and see a clear success or error message
  - Only supported file types are accepted

### Phase 2: Data Validation & Feedback
- **Action Points:**
  - Check uploaded data for required fields and logical consistency
  - Display a summary of valid and invalid records to the user
  - Allow user to correct or re-upload data if needed
- **Validation Points:**
  - User is notified of missing or invalid fields before data is stored
  - User can review and confirm the data before final import

### Phase 3: Data Storage & Confirmation
- **Action Points:**
  - Store validated listings in the database, linked to the client
  - Prevent duplicate listings
  - Show a summary of imported listings and their status
- **Validation Points:**
  - User can see a list of successfully imported listings
  - No duplicate or missing records in the database

### Phase 4: Support for Feeds & APIs
- **Action Points:**
  - Add option to connect via public feed URL (XML/JSON/CSV)
  - Add option to connect to popular real estate APIs (MLS, IDX, SaaS)
  - Guide user through authentication or feed setup
- **Validation Points:**
  - User can connect a feed or API and see their data imported
  - System handles common errors (invalid URL, auth failure, unsupported format)

### Phase 5: Import Status & History
- **Action Points:**
  - Track the status of each import (pending, processing, complete, error)
  - Show import history and status to the user
- **Validation Points:**
  - User can view the status of current and past imports
  - Errors and warnings are clearly explained

### Phase 6: Security & Access Control
- **Action Points:**
  - Ensure only authorized users can upload or view data
  - Secure all data transmissions and storage
- **Validation Points:**
  - Unauthorized users cannot access the upload or data pages
  - All data is handled securely and privately

### Phase 7: Extensibility & Support
- **Action Points:**
  - Design the system so new data source types can be added easily
  - Provide help or support options for custom integrations
- **Validation Points:**
  - New data source types can be added with minimal changes
  - Users can request help and receive support for unique needs
